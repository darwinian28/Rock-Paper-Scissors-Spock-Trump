    <p>Welcome to my page, and thank you for visiting.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I improve my coding techniques I hope this page
    </p>



    <p>
        will include some truly awesome games, puzzles
    </p>

    <p>
      and helpful apps.
    </p>

    <p>
       My first project is a new take on the old game of
    </p>

    <p>
      Rock-Paper-Scissors which you might like
      to try out.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment you can play against the
      computer,
    </p>

    <p>
       but I will be enhancing it to a level where
      you
    </P>

    <p>
    will be able to play the game with your friends.
    </p>

    <p>Welcome to my page and thank you for visiting.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I improve my coding techniques I hope this page
      will include some truly awesome games, puzzles and
      helpful apps.  My first project is a new take on the
      old game of Rock-Paper-Scissors which you might like
      to try out.  At the moment you can play against the
      computer, but I will be enhancing it to a level where
      you will be able to play the game with your friends.

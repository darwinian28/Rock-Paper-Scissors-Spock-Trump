As I improve my coding techniques I hope this page will include some truly awesome games, puzzles and helpful apps.  My first project is a new take on the old game of Rock-Paper-Scissors which you might like to try out.  At the moment you can play against the computer, but I will be enhancing it to a level where you will be able to play the game with your friends.
